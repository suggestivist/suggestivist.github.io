		<h2>Welcome!</h2>
		<p>Welcome to Suggestivist's official website!</p>
	    	<p>We have <a href="https://soundcloud.com/suggestivist">a SoundCloud page</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_3jWntT696QuIzekJzjNnA">a YouTube channel</a>, and <a href="http://www.nicovideo.jp/user/81757141">a Niconico Douga channel</a>. You could listen to our musics there.</p>
		<p>We are related with Monday Wish Project music group. Monday Wish Project is a music group created by Boby Selamet Hartono and Irvan Agusti Maulana. You could access the YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrrIGPuD_HilHVep_SZHS9g">channel here</a>.</p>
    		<p>We've decided that our musics which could be accessed via this site (including Google Drive links) are free to download. And we're sorry. Even the owner was confused as he doesn't really understand copyright and stuff. He had just realized that commercial stuffs aren't allowed on GitHub Pages.</p>
	    	<p>You could also visit <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-958567820">Boby's SoundCloud page</a>!</p>
	    	<p>We hope you enjoy the visit!</p>
